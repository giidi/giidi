Hi 👋 My name is Gidi Sweijd
============================

Computer Science Student
------------------------

I started coding when I took IT at the start of grade 10 in high school. The first language we were taught was Delphi. Later we came to learn that it is almost a completely dead language and would be no use to us at all in the real world, but I thought it was a really fun & basic starter language and helped me learn python and java really quickly throughout the first couple of semesters at Uni. I'm just on this site to develop myself into a full time developer.

* 🌍  I'm based in Cape Town
* ✉️  You can contact me at [gidzil03@gmail.com](mailto:gidzil03@gmail.com)
* 🧠  I'm learning Java and JavaScript
* 🤝  I'm open to collaborating on interesting projects :p
* ⚡  I'm trying to build confidence in coding as it can be demotivating at times.
